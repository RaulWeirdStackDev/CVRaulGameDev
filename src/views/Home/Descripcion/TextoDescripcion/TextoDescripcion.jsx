  Hello, World! 🌎<br />
  I'm Raúl — a former English teacher turned Game Developer on an epic quest to enhance your gaming experience 🎮😎<br />
  My background gave me strong skills in communication, leadership, and learning autonomy. I even unlocked a certified C2 level of English — the final boss of language proficiency! ⚔🐉
  <br /><br />
  Now, I’m building responsive, user-centered web apps with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL and Node.js, as well as being an effective party member with Git.
  <br /><br />
  As a lifelong gamer, it was only natural to evolve into Game Developer. I’ve created games using Unity, C#, Phaser, and Vanilla JS — check out my portfolio to see what I’ve been crafting 🧙🏻‍♂️✨.
  <br /><br />
  Thanks for joining my party on this adventure — let’s level up together! 💪🏻
